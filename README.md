i created a form, then used useRef() to extract the values, then using spread operator i added the values to my existing contacts array. then in my contacts page, i mapped through the contacts array and displayed my contacts on the screen. i added a delete button that when clicked, triggers a function and passes the "id" of the clicked contact and filters the contacts array, creating a new array of contacts whose id does not match the passed id. i plan to save my contacts to local storage, so that the contacts are not lost when page is refreshed . i also added a profile image section, although not made functional.
